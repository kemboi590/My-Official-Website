      description: "I built a Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and mainly concepts of JavaScript. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of web development to create an interactive and engaging game that challenged players. Through the implementation of JavaScript concepts such as arrays, functions, and loops, I was able to create a functional and dynamic game that allowed players to experience the thrill of playing Blackjack. This project not only helped me understand the implementation of JavaScript concepts but also allowed me to hone my skills in HTML and CSS, including designing and styling the user interface. I developed this project as a part of my coursework at Freecode camp, an online platform that helped me learn and master web development skills. Overall, this project was a great learning experience that allowed me to apply my skills.",
