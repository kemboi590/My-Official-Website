      title: "CMC Motors Clone",
      description: "My first project, CMC Motors, is a clone of one of the largest car importers and assemblers in Kenya, the CMC Motors Group Limited. As a frontend web development project, I used HTML and CSS to build my skills in creating responsive and visually appealing web pages. CMC Motors is a vital player in the East African Community's automotive industry, and my clone project allowed me to explore and understand the design and functionality of their website. By replicating the CMC Motors website, I was able to gain valuable experience in creating a professional-looking website that effectively communicates information about a business and its products. This project helped me develop my frontend web development skills and gave me a solid foundation to build on as I continue to learn and growing this field",

    description: "My First Portfolio Site was my first personal website, where I utilized basic technologies of HTML and CSS. The project was designed to practice the skills I gained after learning the basics of web development. The website allowed me to experiment with different design elements and learn how to create visually appealing web pages.The My First Portfolio Site project played a significant role in my development as a web developer, as it helped me understand the importance of user experience and taught me how to create functional and aesthetically pleasing websites. I continue to use the skills I learned in this project to build improved web pages today.",

      title: "BlackJack-Game",
      description: "I built a Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and mainly concepts of JavaScript. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of web development to create an interactive and engaging game that challenged players. Through the implementation of JavaScript concepts such as arrays, functions, and loops, I was able to create a functional and dynamic game that allowed players to experience the thrill of playing Blackjack. This project not only helped me understand the implementation of JavaScript concepts but also allowed me to hone my skills in HTML and CSS, including designing and styling the user interface. I developed this project as a part of my coursework at Freecode camp, an online platform that helped me learn and master web development skills. Overall, this project was a great learning experience that allowed me to apply my skills.",

      description: "The Link Saver App is a project I  built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app was designed to help users save important URL links as they navigate the web, and I was able to learn the use of local storage in the process in FreeCode camp. By implementing local storage, users can save their links on the app and refer to them later, even after closing their browser. This project allowed me to develop my skills in web development, including designing and styling the user interface, implementing functionality using JavaScript, and working with local storage. As I continue to develop my skills in web development, I am working on turning this project into a browser extension. This extension will help users save important links they can refer to later, making it easier for them to access the information they need.",

      description: "Prinf project is a C programming project I completed while studying at ALX Africa Software Engineering Holberton School. The project involved creating a function named '_printf' that would imitate the actual 'printf' command located in the stdio.h library. By implementing my skills in the C programming language, I was able to create a functional and dynamic program that allowed me to format and print output in a variety of ways.This project was a significant milestone in my development as a software engineer, as it allowed me to deepen my understanding of the C programming language and develop my skills in software development. Through this project, I learned how to design and implement complex algorithms, work with different data structures, and solve complex problems using programming techniques",
